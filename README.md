# phrack-pdf

downloads all the phrack zines and then stitches together the articles into single issue PDFs for reading on a tablet like the reMarkable.

this repo contains the code to make the PDFs, as well as the PDFs themselves (because I couldn't find this anywhere online).

## do it
```shell
./main.sh
```
